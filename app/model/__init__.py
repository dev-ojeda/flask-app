# The line `from flask import Blueprint` is importing the `Blueprint` class from the Flask framework.
# This allows the current Python module to use the `Blueprint` class to create modular components for
# organizing routes, views, and static files within a Flask application.
from flask import Blueprint

# This line of code is creating a Flask Blueprint named 'user'. A Blueprint is a way to organize a
# group of related views, templates, and static files. The first argument 'user' is the name of the
# Blueprint, and the second argument '__name__' is a special Python variable that represents the name
# of the current module. This line essentially creates a Blueprint object that can be used to define
# routes and views specific to the 'user' module.
user = Blueprint("user", __name__)
# The line `from . import user_class` is importing the `user_class` module from the current package or
# directory. The dot `.` represents the current package or directory, so this line is importing the
# `user_class` module that is located in the same package or directory as the current module. This
# allows the current module to access and use the classes, functions, or variables defined in the
# `user_class` module.
from . import user_class, form_validator
